## What It Does

**Aria** is an AI voice assistant designed specifically for seniors in the *Senior Smart Community* — a holistic platform addressing elderly social isolation through AI, smart transport, and community infrastructure.

The assistant bridges the gap between seniors who want to engage with their community and the technology barriers that stop them. Instead of typing, clicking through menus, or navigating complex UIs, seniors simply **speak** — and Aria responds with a warm, synthesized voice.

```

Finished generating response in 0.72 seconds.
Finished generating audio in 1.85 seconds.

 --- Senior Andranik: good morning Aria
 --- Aria: Good morning, Senior Andranik! How can I assist you today?

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
🎤 User speaks
    ↓
⌨️  Deepgram converts speech → text  (real-time STT)
    ↓
🤖  OpenAI GPT-3 generates a response
    ↓
📢  ElevenLabs converts response → voice  (AI voice synthesis)
    ↓
🔊  Pygame plays the audio
    ↓
💻  Taipy updates the live web interface
```

Five AI/API services working in concert — integrated end-to-end in Python.

## 🏗️ Architecture

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `main.py` | Core voice loop — listen → transcribe → generate → speak |
| `display.py` | Taipy web server, renders conversation in real time |
| `record.py` | Microphone capture and audio handling |
| `display.css` | Accessible UI styling |
| `conv.txt` / `status.txt` | Shared state between voice loop and web display |
| `audio/` | ElevenLabs synthesized audio output |
| `requirements.txt` | Full dependency list |

---

## 🧠 Why These Design Choices

### ElevenLabs for voice synthesis
Generic TTS sounds robotic — which erodes trust for elderly users. ElevenLabs produces warm, natural speech, making Aria feel less like a tool and more like a companion.

### Deepgram for speech recognition
Optimized for real-time, low-latency transcription. Critical for elderly users who speak slowly or pause — Deepgram handles this better than alternatives.

### Taipy for the web interface
Provides a live-updating conversation display without the complexity of a full frontend framework. Seniors and caregivers can monitor the conversation on screen while audio plays.

### Separation of `main.py` and `display.py`
Running the voice loop and web UI as separate processes keeps the assistant responsive during API calls — the display updates asynchronously while audio is still being generated.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8–3.11
- API keys for [Deepgram](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/authenticating), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), and [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SyuzannE/SeniorAssistant.git
cd SeniorAssistant
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file:

```env
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_key_here
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Run

```bash
# Terminal 1 — start the web display
python display.py

# Terminal 2 — start the voice assistant
python main.py
```

Once both are running, the terminal shows `Listening...`. Speak into the microphone — Aria responds in audio and updates the web interface simultaneously.

## 🖥️ Web Interface

![Screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad126185-1181-4ac0-a364-924475466f87)

Renders the full conversation in real time, accessible from any browser on the local network. Designed with large text and high contrast for senior accessibility.

## 🔬 Research Foundation

This assistant was built from a rigorous HCI research foundation:

- **User interviews** with elderly users revealed voice as the most natural interface for seniors with limited digital literacy
- **Empathy mapping** identified core emotional needs: feeling heard, not confused, never abandoned mid-task
- **Persona design** ("Senior Andranik", 70, retired teacher in Yerevan) grounded every design decision in a specific human context
- **Survey data**: 65% of surveyed seniors reported dissatisfaction with current social support — validating the need for an always-available AI companion

## 🌐 Broader Project Context

Aria is the AI layer of the **Senior Smart Community** — a full ecosystem:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Aria (this repo)** | Voice AI assistant — the personal companion layer |
| **Smart Bus** | AI-integrated accessible transport with voice booking |
| **Web Platform** | Activity discovery, registration, event management |
| **Community Spaces** | 15 purpose-designed physical spaces (art, library, gym, garden…) |

All components are designed to interoperate — Aria can book Smart Bus rides, register for activities, and navigate the community platform on a senior's behalf.
